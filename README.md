User for type JS,to catch errors early in your project, and to make code more safer.
### React
React offers effective and fast updating of the page, uses a component approach, the library is clear and comfortable in development. Also, 
React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. That Ñ–s why we decided that it is the best solution to use this library :)
